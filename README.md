# Imperial Teaching Fellow for Research Computing - interview task

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with Python code that implements a backtesting strategy. Your task is to explain this code to an MBA student of an introductory Python programming course in 10 minutes. This code example is to motivate them to pursue a further study.

- The student has a good knowledge of the basic programming constructs, however, they do not know all imported packages. 
- The objective is not to explain every detail; we are looking for a concise explanation of the code that highlights the application
