# Imperial Teaching Fellow - Research Computing interview task

## This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with Python code that implements backtesting strategy. Your task is to explain this code to a student of an introductory Python programming course (they have been studying Python for a few weeks). They have a good knowledge of the basic programming constructs, however, they do not know all imported packages. This code is to motivate them to pursue further study.
